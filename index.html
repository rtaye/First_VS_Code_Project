<h3>Location</h3>
<p>
    Erta Ale (or Ertale or Irta'ale; Amharic: ኤርታሌ) is a continuously active basaltic 
    shield volcano in the Afar Region 
    of northeastern Ethiopia. It is situated in the Afar Depression, 
    a barren desert area. Erta Ale is the most active volcano in Ethiopia.

  <h3>Geology</h3>   
<p>
    Erta Ale is 613 metres (2,011 ft) high, with one or sometimes two active 
    lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow
     on the south side of the volcano.[1] It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava lake, 
     present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906). Volcanoes with lava lakes 
     are very rare: there are only eight in the world.[4] Erta Ale means "smoking mountain" 
     in the local Afar language and its southernmost pit is known locally as "the gateway to Hell". 
     In 2009, it was mapped by a team from the BBC using three-dimensional laser techniques,[5] 
     in order for the mapping team to maintain a distance and avoid the lakes' searingly hot temperatures.

<h2>In popular Culture</h2>
<p>The lava lake on Erta Ale was shown briefly during the 2010 movie 
    Clash of the Titans during the journey sequence where Perseus travels 
    to the underworld. Erta Ale is featured in the 2016 Werner Herzog documentary, 
    Into the Inferno.
